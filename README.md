elasticsearch tests
===================

I really like elasticsearch and from now on when people ask me how to do a certain request, I'll share it here.


Usage
-----

First, you need to have elasticsearch installed and running.

Then, install https://github.com/humangeo/rawes:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Adjust the index you want to use and run the script:

    python bulk_api.py
